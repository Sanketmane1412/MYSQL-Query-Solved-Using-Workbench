# MYSQL-Query-Solved-Using-Workbench

I have a strong foundation in MySQL and feel confident writing clear, logical, and interview-ready SQL queries. I am comfortable using SELECT statements with WHERE conditions, logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), comparison operators, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, and ORDER BY with LIMIT for effective data filtering and sorting.

I have hands-on experience with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX. I clearly understand the difference between row-level filtering with WHERE and group-level filtering with HAVING. I can write GROUP BY and HAVING queries to tackle real-world reporting and analysis tasks, such as department-wise and city-wise summaries.

I have also practiced creating tables, inserting data, understanding primary key concepts, and designing basic datasets for query practice. Additionally, I have started learning SQL JOINs, including INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, SELF, and CROSS JOINs, along with their practical uses.

Overall, I feel confident solving medium-level SQL problems on my own and translating business needs into effective SQL logic while progressing toward advanced queries and real-world case studies.
